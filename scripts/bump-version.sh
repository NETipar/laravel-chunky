#   scripts/bump-version.sh 0.21.0
#
# Composer (Packagist) reads the version from the git tag, so there's
# nothing to bump in composer.json — only the four npm package.json
# files need to be kept in sync. The npm-publish workflow runs a
# version-sync verification step against the release tag and refuses
# to publish if the four versions disagree, so this script is the
# canonical way to bump them in lockstep.
